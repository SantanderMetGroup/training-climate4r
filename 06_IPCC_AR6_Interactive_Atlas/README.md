# IPCC AR6 Interactive Atlas

The Interactive Atlas ([https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch))
developed as part of the last IPCC Working Group I Assessment Report (AR6) relied on climate4R
to compute all indices shown and many other processing tasks.
In this module we present the different components of the Interactive Atlas and explore the
notebooks reproducing key resources of the Atlas. They can be found at the
[IPCC WGI Atlas repository on GitHub](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/tree/main/notebooks).
