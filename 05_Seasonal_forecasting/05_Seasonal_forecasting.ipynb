Here, we illustrate this step using the data from the CFSv2 hindcast (`dataset = \"CFSv2_seasonal\"`). Note that the only difference between this example call to `loadECOMS` and a request for the other two hindcasts compared in the paper, would lie just in the dataset argument: `dataset = \"Glosea5_seasonal_24\"` for the UKMO Glosea5 hindcast of 24 members, or `dataset = \"System4_seasonal_51\"` for the ECMWF System4 seasonal hindcast of 51 members. Thanks to the [data harmonization](http://meteo.unican.es/ecoms-udg/RPackage/homogeneization) performed by `loadeR.ECOMS`, the rest of parameters (variable naming...) remain exactly the same. Member selection is also transparent to users, who don't need to worry about the different member configurations. As an example, see the CFSv2 [lagged runtime member configuration](http://meteo.unican.es/ecoms-udg/dataserver/datasets/CFSv2) and the definition of members undertaken via `loadECOMS`.\n",
